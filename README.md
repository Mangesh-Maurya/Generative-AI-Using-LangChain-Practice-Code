# 🤖 Generative AI Using LangChain – Practice Code

This repository contains hands-on code and practice examples from a playlist focused on building intelligent, conversational, and reasoning AI applications using **LangChain**.

We cover core LangChain concepts like **LLM chaining**, **memory**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, **agents**, and how to build real-world applications like chatbots, document Q&A, and AI assistants.

## 📌 Description

This is a practical guide to understanding and implementing LangChain concepts with real code. Each section includes modular examples to help you:
- Chain LLM calls using LangChain
- Use memory for conversational context
- Build RAG pipelines for smarter AI
- Create agents that can reason and interact using tools
